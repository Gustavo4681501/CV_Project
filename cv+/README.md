Our application, aptly named "cv+," revolutionizes the user experience by offering a seamless onboarding process that begins with the choice of two distinct registrations: users or companies. Upon initial access, individuals can opt for a user account or register their company, setting the stage for a tailored journey through our platform.

For companies, the login experience unfolds into a comprehensive view of their corporate profile. This profile encapsulates vital information such as the company's name, email address, and phone number. Adding a layer of personalization, companies can also manage their profile image, providing flexibility to update, change, or entirely remove it. The navigation bar, a central hub for exploration, guides users through various routes.

Within the navbar, one can find the "Add Vacancy" route, empowering companies to create job openings complete with specific requirements. The "Show My Vacancies" feature allows for a quick review of published job openings. The "Users" section presents an opportunity to delve into the profiles of all users on the platform, offering a comprehensive understanding of each user's background and expertise. The inclusion of a logout button ensures a seamless transition out of the platform.

Shifting the focus to the user experience, logging in grants access to a multifaceted profile, encompassing personal information, profile images, skills, educational background, work experiences, projects, and social links. The navbar, an intuitive guide through the user interface, features a series of icons leading to different routes.

The "Vacancies" route exposes users to a myriad of available job openings, providing a gateway to potential career opportunities. "Users" opens up a window into the profiles of fellow users, offering an interactive space where comments can be added to provide constructive feedback and encouragement. "Comments" consolidates feedback received from other users, creating a space for meaningful engagement.

Additionally, the "Add Information" route allows users to input and showcase details that will be visible in their portfolio and resume. "Create Resume" introduces a selection of templates, each presenting the user's information in a distinct layout. Users can peruse these options, select the one that aligns with their preferences, and seamlessly download the finalized resume.

The experience is completed with thoughtful options for logout and the prominent display of our logo, creating a cohesive and user-friendly environment within the "cv+" application.
